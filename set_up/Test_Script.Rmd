## R Markdown

Congratulations! You've opened your first script in RStudio. Change author from "Laurie Baker" to "Your Name", e.g. "Joanna Smith". Don't forget the quotes! Feel free to change the date too!

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. You can add headings using multiple hashes, '##'. Fewer hashes the bigger the heading (e.g. '##' vs. '###'). You can also make words **bold**, and words *italic*. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

### Adding Code Chunks

When you click "Knit to html", a new html document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this, or clicking "+C Insert" on the menu:


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Adding Comments to Code

```{r}
head(cars) # You can add comments to code using '#'
```


Click the small down arrow next to the **Knit** button on the menu and select "Knit to html". Congrats, you've generated your first markdown html document.
