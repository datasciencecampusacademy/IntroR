## Putting in a SAW Request to install R and Rstudio.

From **Insight**, navigate to **Service Anywhere**-> **Systems and Software** -> Type **"Request Software"** in the search -> Click **Request Service**. 

In the form that opens fill in the following:

R and Rstudio are completely free, however, you will still need to supply a Component Code. Ask your line manager for the appropriate **Component Code to charge any licence costs to**. No charges will be made! Give a 2 day window for when the software is required.


## Once the SAW Request is completed

Open the file:  Test_Script.Rmd in RStudio.
